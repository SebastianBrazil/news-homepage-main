TechNews Home Page

This project mimics the home page of a tech news website. It shows what can be links through the use of hover color changing, and can fit onto any device. 

2/5/24: Created all of the grid divs that hold the information for the website. Added the images, text, and minimal styling. 2/6/24, pt 1: Completely finished the styling and added the hover effects. Now all that is needed is responsiveness. 2/6/24, pt 2: Responsiveness is done, finished.

Peer Review: Ashur: Really good work in similarities in every details.. the only thing i found is that the main image is not changing from "image-web-3-desktop" to "image-web-3-mobile" when switching from desktop to mobile

(SB: As long as the JS works on other computers the image switch should work.)
